	<h2>Cockatoo</h2>
		<p>	Cockatoos are great companion birds. They develop a very strong bond with their owner. Some can be like a spoiled child and demand attention throughout the day! They are very smart and and can figure out tricks easily. Some take apart toys or figure how to open their cage door with ease!</p>
		<p>	These beautiful birds originate from Australia and the surrounding islands. Cockatoos can live 60+ years. There are seventeen species of cockatoos. Goffin's are the smallest, measuring about 12"-14" in length. Goliath Palm Cockatoos are the largest, measuring about 27" in length. Prices of cockatoos can be $400 - $30,000. These birds are not for first time bird owners, they require a lot of attention and are a huge responsibility. The average cost for toys and food for one month is $100 per bird.</p>
		<p>	Never buy an unweaned baby. If possible buy a cockatoo from a quality breeder. The price will be more affordable and most importantly the bird should be socialized with humans. Good breeders train the the baby cockatoo and only sell them when they are weaned, eating on their own and know basic commands like "Step Up". If you find a breeder with really low prices keep in mind you get what you pay for. Sometimes getting a deal for a cockatoo also means getting a low quality, unsocialized or untrained cockatoo. Also, a cockatoo that was allowed to stay and learn from its parents for the first six weeks of its life already knows how to be a cockatoo. If the cockatoo was hatched from an incubator and was hand-reared from the very first moment of its life then that bird has missed out on social development and many lessons so it may not even know it is a cockatoo! It may think it is a little human and be very dependent and attached to you which can cause problems later. When a cockatoo is young it should be taught how to play on its own and other basic lessons. It is very important to set rules and stick to them. Many cockatoos develop behavior problems and then the owner gets rid of them because they can't deal with it. Most of the time the problem is screaming.</p>
		<p>	Adopting an adult cockatoo from a rescue can come with a huge challenge but can end up being very rewarding. In most cases adult cockatoos need a new home because their owner could no longer take care of them or because they have a behavior problem and their owner could not take it anymore. Whatever the reason these cockatoos deserve good homes too. They need someone to spend one-on-one time with them and figure out what the problem is or help them if they already know. Training sessions each day, unconditional love, patience and research are required!</p>

		<h3>FEW THING THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT COCKATOO CARE</h3>
		<li>Learn as much as you can about cockatoos BEFORE you rescue or purchase one. They can be demanding so it is best to know what to expect. Cockatoos are often surrendered to bird sanctuaries and rescues because people do not know a lot about this type of bird. Cockatoos are needy and manipulative. If they are not trained they can develop behavioral problems.</li>
		<li>If you aren't going to be able to spend a lot of time with your cockatoo it is best not to get one. If they do not get the attention they crave they could begin to pluck their feathers or scream. Cockatoos are flock birds, they live in huge flocks in the wild. They feel security by being with their flock. It would be really hard on them to live a solitary existence and then eventually hard on you when they begin to show their unhappiness.</li>
		<li>Cockatoos can be destructive and love to chew. Your cockatoo must learn how to amuse itself without you. That way it knows it doesn't need you to have fun. Toys are a must but won't stop cockatoos from chewing your antique table! Supervision is necessary anytime your cockatoo is out of its cage.</li>
		<li>Training is very important. Behavior problems are common but can be controled with proper daily training. Set rules and be consistent. Even if your cockatoo is being cute and cuddly you must enforce the rules. Cockatoos are known for munipulating their owners and that is how the problems begin.</li>
		<li>Clean your cockatoo's cage regularly.Don't use regular house cleaning products around your cockatoo. Hot water and apple cider vinegar work great. Change the paper everyday. Wipe down the cage and dry it once a week. Then once a month take everything out, scrub and wash it all very well then dry it. This is a great time to arrange the perches and food dishes differently. Add some new toys and both you and your cockatoo are happy.</li>
		<li>It may need time to get used to new things and new people. Observe your cockatoo. You will then become accustomed to their behavior patterns and see their personality develop. Cockatoos can become lovable, tame and trusting companions. It may take time and work but the end result is a great and rewarding one!</li>

			<h1>Cockatiel</h1>
				<p> The scientific name for cockatiels is Nymphicus Hollandicus, which means "Goddess of New Holland." You may also hear them referred to as "Tiels" for short. Australia is the native homeland of cockatiels. Our pet cockatiels are bred domestically because Australia banned exportation of all native birds in 1894.
					They are social and intelligent companion birds. Cockatiels are exotic birds known for their beautiful crests, the orange patch on their cheeks and their long sleek tails. These charming birds provide us with lots of entertainment, affection and companionship.
					Cockatiels are extremely social birds. They have a need for social interaction. A single bird will get more attached to its keeper but if you are not at home a lot it is best to get two birds. It is a fact that two birds of the same sex get along just as well as a mixed pair. Even more so if the cockatiels were introduced while they are still young.
					Always try to purchase a hand-fed baby or a young bird when possible. Hand-fed chicks are already hand tame so you won't have as much training and socializing with hands to do. A young chick can be easy to train but may take a bit longer. Chicks should be weaned at seven to eight weeks old. If you purchase a cockatiel younger than that you should hand feed it until it is eating completely on its own. If you have no experience hand feeding, I recommend not purchasing an unweaned baby. A weaned chick will bond easily to its new owner as soon as it is comfortable in its new surroundings.
					If you are purchasing an adult cockatiel it may already be tame and even have some tricks under its feathers! If not, an adult cockatiel can be hand tamed but takes much time and patience. It may be a challenge but is very rewarding to give an adult cockatiel a chance to become bonded to its new owner.

		<h3>TEN THINGS TO REMEMBER ON PROPER CARE</h3>
				<p><li>	A happy bird is a busy bird. If you aren't going to be able to spend a lot of time with your cockatiel it is best to get two. They will have each other to eat, play, preen and sit with.</li>
					<li>Whenever approaching or dealing with cockatiels, act calmly and quietly. Fast movements and loud noises alert the bird and make it nervous. Do not approach a cockatiel unexpectedly with quick movements as this will scare it.</li>
					<li>Get your cockatiel used to your hands and fingers. When you are trying to get the cockatiel to step onto your hand or finger raise your hand to the abdomen from below and encourage it to step onto you. Putting your hand over its head will make it nervous as if you are trying to catch it.</li>
					<li>A cockatiel cannot be housebroken. But if you pay a lot of attention to your bird you can get an idea of when it will do the business. Cockatiels usually move their tail up a bit and move back. A damp cloth or tissue usually takes care it.</li>
					<li>Never leave a cockatiel alone with another pet or a child under the age of 12. Even if a dog is gentle and calm it could hurt the cockatiel by trying to play with it. If you have other types of birds just make sure when they are out of their cages they are not aggressive toward each other.<li>
						A busy bird is a happy bird. Provide lots of toys and things to chew. Rearranging the inside of the cage and rotating toys keeps cockatiels alert. The same perch arrangement and toys can lead to boredom. New things are appreciated.

	<h1>MACAW</h1>
				<p>	The macaw is a colourful tropical parrot native to Central and Southern America. There are 17 different species of macaw found in the rainforests of South America. Many of the different macaw species are today considered to be endangered animals.</p>
				<p>	The macaw is an omnivorous animal and feeds on nuts and fruit in the trees along with insects, eggs and small mammals and reptiles. The macaw is known to sleep during the night meaning that the macaw is a diurnal animal, and in the morning the macaw will often fly long distances in order to find food.</p>
				<p>	The macaw is one of the largest species of parrot in the world, with the average adult macaw growing to more than a meter in height. The macaw is well known for it's array of brightly coloured feathers which are often many different colours including blue, red, yellow and green.</p>
				<p>	Macaws have recently become very popular as pets, and there is a flourishing black market for some of the rarer breeds of macaw. This only contributes to their endangered status. Please, do not buy imported macaws. The declining macaw populations is also due to the fact that the macaw's natural rainforest habitat is being destroyed due to deforestation, which is happening all over Central and South America at an alarming rate.</p>
				<p>	The macaw has a large and powerful beak which means that the macaw can break the shells of nuts and seeds more easily. Like other species of parrot, macaws have four toes on each foot, with two toes facing forward and two toes facing backward. This foot adaptation helps the macaw to grip onto prey and tree branches more easily and allows the macaw to perch in the trees without slipping off.</p>
				<p>	Macaws are known to be intelligent and very sociable birds and macaws can often be seen together in large flocks of up to 30 macaw individuals. Macaws communicate between one another using loud vocal calls such as squawking and screaming. Some species of macaw are even known to be able to mimic (copy) human sounds.</p>
				<p>	The macaw is one of the world's animals that is known to have the same breeding partner for their whole lives. Macaw couples do not only breed together but they also share their food and help to groom one another. When the female macaw has laid her eggs (typically 2 but more are common), the female macaw sits on her eggs to incubate them while the male macaw hunts and collects food for them both. The macaw chicks hatch after about a month.</p>
				<p>	Macaws are well known to humans in the areas in which they inhabit and have been known to be hunted by local tribesmen for their brightly coloured feathers. The macaw however, is also widely respected and even appears on the one of the Brazilian bank notes.</p>

	<h3>FACTS ABOUT MACAW</h3>
			<li><h3>	Macaws are the largest of all the parrots.</h3>
					for a bird -- their bones are hollow in order to make them lighter, so that they can 
					achieve flight. The largest of the macaws, the Hyacinth Macaw, can reach lengths of 
					nearly 3 and a half feet long from the beak to the tip of the tail. In addition, they 	
					boast a wingspan of up to 60 inches, which is a whopping 5 feet!</li>
			<li>	<h3> Macaws come in a variety of sizes.</h3>
					While Macaws are widely known as the largest parrots, it is worth noting that there are 
					many different types of Macaws that come in a variety of sizes. The smallest Macaws, 
					known affectionately as Mini Macaws, sometimes only grow to lengths of 12 inches, or 
					about the size of a medium sized Conure or large Parakeet. No matter how big or small 
					they are, all Macaws (with the exception of the Hyacinth Macaw) share a few common 
					attributes, the most prominent being the bare rings of skin around their eyes. For many 
					people, this is the most recognizable trait among the Macaws.</li>
			<li>	<h3>Macaws can live for 80+ years.</h3>
					You may have heard bird lovers mention before that birds can live for nearly 100 years -- 
					and this is absolutely true, and especially in Macaws. When properly taken care of, some 
					Macaw species, such as Blue and Gold Macaws can for an average of 60 years, and many have 
					been recorded to live for up to 80 years or even more. For this reason, those who are 
					interested in adopting a Macaw are strongly cautioned to make sure that they are willing 
					to commit a large amount of time to caring for their pet. It is not at all uncommon for 
					these birds to outlive their owners, so provisions must be made for their care in those 
					types of unfortunate events.</li>
			<li>	<h3>It is possible to breed hybrid Macaws.</h3>
					As many different varieties of Macaws as there are naturally, breeders in the pet trade 
					have also been able to interbreed these birds to make bold and colorful Hybrid Macaws. 
					Examples of hybrid Macaws include the Catalina Macaw, the Harlequin Macaw, and the 
					Camelot Macaw. While these birds have been extraordinarily popular among pet owners, 
					there are many who oppose the breeding of hybrid Macaws based on the fact that these 
					birds to not normally occur naturally in the wild. For more information on the hybrid 
					Macaw debate, check out these reader opinions on breeding hybrid Macaws. If you feel so 
					inclined, you can also add your own response here!</li>
			<li>	<h3>Some Macaws are strong enough to crack coconut shells.</h3>
					Hyacinth Macaws such as the one pictured to the left have enough strength in their 
					massive beaks to crack a coconut shell -- but in spite of this, they are actually known 
					as the "gentle giants" of the Macaw world due to their sweet and affectionate 
					dispositions when raised as handfed babies. Other types of Macaws also wield a powerful 
					and impressive beak, making them a force to be reckoned with during acts of aggression or 
					bouts of hormonal behav</li>

	<h3>AFRICAN GRAY PARROTS</h3>
	<p>African Grey Parrots are intelligent and charming,… and the best talkers of all the exotic birds!</p>
	<p>The African Grey Parrot is one of the most popular pet birds with an amazing ability to talk. This fabulous bird is not only handsome, but is also an inquisitive, interactive and charming companion. Their personality and intuitive nature will amaze and delight you, and their antics will amuse you to no end. These are very intelligent social creatures, making them an excellent pet for a devoted parrot owner.</p>
	<p>African Grey Parrots are sought out as a pet for their good looks and strong speaking ability. Yet talking is just one of the Grey Parrot’s learned skills, they are also great mimics of the sounds in their environment. They can distinguish and mimic the voices of individual people, as well as things like the other birds, the phone ringing, the microwave, and more. Although they can talk and mimic, they are neither overly noisy nor tend to engage in loud shrieking calls like some of the other vocal parrots.</p>
	<p>With all these great qualities, African Greys are very favored parrots to keep as a pet, but these parrots do take a very committed keeper. They are highly intelligent so can quickly become bored if not provided with plenty of stimulation. They need continuous human interaction along with lots of safe, but destructible toys to manipulate.</p>
	<p>Greys like being handled, but are also perfectly content to just be around the family. They have natural wild instincts still intact so must have supervision and care taken when interacting with people. They can be likened to the intellect of a 5 year old, but the emotions of a two year old. So they need strong socialization when young, and then ongoing training to be good members of your family.</p>
	<p>The bird guides for each of the two common species, the Congo African Grey Parrot, and the Timneh African Grey, provide in-depth information about living with them and their activity needs, along with housing, care and feeding.</p>

	<h3>GRAY HISTORY</h3>
	<p>The keeping African Grey Parrots as pets is noted throughout history, probably back to biblical times. One early author of the latter part of the 1800’s, Dr. W. T. Greene, wrote several volumes on bird species including “The Grey Parrot and How to Treat It”, 1885. He believed this parrot was actually known to the ancient Hebrews some 4000 years ago. In early days the Grey Parrot was frequently called “Jaco” relating to the sound of their natural cry, possibly originating with Portuguese seafarers who kept their company on long sea voyages.</p>
	<p>	There are a number of literary citations and other examples of early keepings of this parrot as a pet. The wealthy nobility of Europe valued this pet for its attractiveness and speaking ability. In the early 1500’s it is said that King Henry VII of England had an African Grey Parrot at Hampton Court.</p>
	<p>	A well-known manuscript by the German naturalist, Johann Matthäus Bechstein, in his classic treatise on cage birds written in 1774, describes an African Grey owned by Cardinal Ascanius. This pet parrot could recite the Apostles’ Creed in an articulate and uninterrupted manner. The oldest surviving example of bird taxidermy is an African Grey Parrot that can be seen in the Westminster Abbey in London. It was the pet parrot of Frances Teresa Stuart, Duchess of Lennox, and it died in 1702, shortly after its mistress.</p>
    <h3>African Grey Parrot Origin</h3>
	<p>The African Grey Parrots Psittacus erithacus are found in a broad area of Western and Central Africa, inhabiting both primary and secondary rainforests. African Greys usually reach maturity at about 4 or 5 years of age, and have a life span of about 50 (or more) years in captivity.</p>

		<h3>African Grey Types</h3>
			There are only three distinct birds in this genus Psittacus erithacus, with the two most popular being the Congo African Grey Parrot and the Timneh African Grey.</p>
		<li><h3>Congo African Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus</h3></li>
			The Congo African Grey is the nominate species of this genus. It is found in the west-central part of Africa mainly within 10 degrees north and south of the equator. This parrot is also known as the Red Tailed Grey, and in aviculture its name is shortened to CAG.
			The African Grey Congo is dark gray with a red patch of feathers on the underside of the tail. They vary between 13 – 16″ (32.5 – 40.6 cm) in length, from beak to tail, with a weight between 400 – 650 grams. Occasionally this bird can be seen with some red feathering throughout its body, and this variant is known as the Red Factor Grey.
		<li><h3>Timneh African Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus timneh</h3></li>
			The Timneh African Grey Parrot naturally occurs in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and the western most parts of the Ivory Coast. It is known as TAG in aviculture.
			The African Grey Timneh is darker gray than its Congo counterpart, and with a maroon tail and it has a pink color on the upper third of the upper mandible. The Timneh also differs from the Congo in its size, being noticeably smaller. The Timneh ranges between 11 – 13″ (27.5 – 32.5 cm) in length from beak to tail, with a weight between 275 – 400 grams.

		<li><h3>	Psittacus erithacus princeps</h3></li>
			Another seldom seen African Grey Parrot, Psittacus e. princeps, can only be found on the islands of Principe and Gernando Po in the Gulf of Guinea. This bird is darker than the regular African Grey.

		<li><h3>	Albino (Blue Ino)- no pigment and are all white</h3></li>
			Incomplete Ino – with only very partial pigmentation
			Blue – white pigment in the tail</p>
